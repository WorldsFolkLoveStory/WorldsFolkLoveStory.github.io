## 皮格马利翁和伽拉忒亚

In book 10 of [Ovid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid)'s **Metamorphoses**, Pygmalion was a Cypriot sculptor who carved a woman out of ivory. Post-classical sources name her [Galatea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatea_(mythology)).

According to Ovid, when Pygmalion saw the [Propoetides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propoetides) of Cyprus practicing prostitution, he began "detesting the faults beyond measure which nature has given to women".[[1\]](#cite_note-1) He determined to remain [celibate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibate) and to occupy himself with sculpting. He made a sculpture of a woman that he found so perfect he fell in love with it. Pygmalion kisses and fondles the sculpture, brings it various gifts, and creates a sumptuous bed for it.

In time, [Aphrodite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite_(mythology))'s festival day came and Pygmalion made offerings at the altar of Aphrodite. There, too afraid to admit his desire, he quietly wished for a bride who would be "the living likeness of my ivory girl". When he returned home, he kissed his ivory statue, and found that its lips felt warm. He kissed it again, and found that the ivory had lost its hardness. Aphrodite had granted Pygmalion's wish.

Pygmalion married the ivory sculpture, which changed to a woman under Aphrodite's blessing. In Ovid's narrative, they had a daughter, Paphos, from whom is derived the name of the [city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paphos).

In some versions, Paphos was a son, and they also had a daughter, [Metharme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metharme).[[2\]](#cite_note-2)

Ovid's mention of Paphos suggests that he was drawing on a more circumstantial account[[3\]](#cite_note-3) than the source for a passing mention of Pygmalion in Pseudo-Apollodorus' [**Bibliotheke**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotheca_(Pseudo-Apollodorus)), a Hellenic mythography of the 2nd-century AD.[[4\]](#cite_note-4) Perhaps he drew on the lost narrative by [Philostephanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philostephanus) that was paraphrased by [Clement of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_of_Alexandria).[[5\]](#cite_note-5) In the story of [Dido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dido), Pygmalion is an evil king.

据[古罗马](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/古罗马)诗人[奥维德](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/奧維德)《[变形记](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/变形记_(奥维德))》中记述，皮格马利翁为一位雕刻家，他根据自己心中理想的女性形象创作了一个[象牙](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/象牙)塑像，并爱上了他的作品，给“她”起名为伽拉忒亚。爱神[阿芙洛狄蒂](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/阿芙蘿黛蒂)（[罗马人](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/羅馬人)称[维纳斯](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/维纳斯)）非常同情他，便给这件雕塑赋予了生命。
